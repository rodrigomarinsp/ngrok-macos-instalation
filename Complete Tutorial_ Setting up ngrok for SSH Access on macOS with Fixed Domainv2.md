## Introduction to ngrok

ngrok stands as one of the most innovative tools in the modern developer's toolkit, serving as a bridge between local development environments and the global internet [1]. Created by Alan Shreve and developed by ngrok Inc., this remarkable solution has revolutionized how developers and system administrators expose local services to the internet securely and efficiently, without the traditional headaches of configuring firewalls, NAT, or router port forwarding.

### Understanding How ngrok Works

The magic behind ngrok lies in its elegant architecture that establishes secure connections between a local agent (installed on your machine) and ngrok's cloud servers [1]. When you initiate an ngrok tunnel, the local agent connects to ngrok servers and establishes an encrypted tunnel. All traffic destined for your ngrok domain gets routed through this tunnel to your local machine.

The process unfolds in a beautifully orchestrated sequence:

1. **Initial Connection**: The ngrok agent on your machine establishes a secure WebSocket connection with ngrok servers
2. **Tunnel Creation**: A tunnel is created between the ngrok server and your local machine
3. **Traffic Routing**: When someone accesses your ngrok domain, traffic is routed through the tunnel to your local machine
4. **Response Handling**: Your local application processes the request and sends the response back through the same tunnel

### Why ngrok Excels for SSH Access

For SSH access specifically, ngrok offers several compelling advantages that make it superior to traditional approaches:

**Simplicity in Configuration**: Gone are the days of wrestling with router configurations or modifying firewall settings. ngrok handles all the networking complexity behind the scenes, allowing you to focus on what matters most - your work.

**Fixed Domains**: With a paid account, you can reserve fixed domains that remain constant across sessions, providing a consistent address for SSH access. This means no more updating SSH configurations every time you restart your tunnel.

**Enhanced Security**: Traffic flows through encrypted channels end-to-end, and you can implement additional authentication layers through ngrok's built-in features. This creates multiple security barriers that protect your system.

**Flexibility**: ngrok works regardless of your local network configuration, making it ideal for corporate networks with restrictions or mobile connections where traditional port forwarding isn't possible.

**Monitoring Capabilities**: ngrok provides detailed logs and access metrics, allowing you to monitor who's accessing your system and when. This visibility is crucial for security and compliance.

### Understanding the Limitations

While ngrok is incredibly powerful, it's important to understand its limitations before implementing it in production environments:

**Third-Party Dependency**: Your SSH access depends on ngrok's service availability. If ngrok servers experience downtime, you'll lose remote access until service is restored.

**Additional Latency**: Traffic passes through ngrok servers, which can introduce additional latency compared to direct connections. For most SSH use cases, this latency is negligible, but it's worth considering for latency-sensitive applications.

**Cost Considerations**: Fixed domains and advanced features require a paid subscription. While the cost is reasonable for most users, it's an ongoing expense to factor into your budget.

**Bandwidth Limitations**: Free accounts have bandwidth restrictions and limits on simultaneous connections. Heavy usage may require upgrading to a paid plan.

### Ideal Use Cases

ngrok for SSH shines in several specific scenarios where traditional approaches fall short:

**Remote Development**: Developers who need to access development machines from various locations find ngrok invaluable. Whether you're working from home, a coffee shop, or traveling, your development environment remains accessible.

**Technical Support**: System administrators providing remote support to systems behind restrictive networks can use ngrok to establish reliable connections without requiring complex network changes.

**Demonstrations**: When showcasing applications or systems to clients, ngrok allows you to provide access without exposing your internal infrastructure or requiring complex setup procedures.

**Temporary Access**: Situations requiring temporary SSH access benefit from ngrok's quick setup and teardown capabilities. You can establish access in minutes and remove it just as quickly.

**Corporate Networks**: Many corporate environments have strict firewall policies that make traditional remote access challenging. ngrok bypasses these restrictions by establishing outbound connections that most corporate firewalls allow.

### The Technology Behind the Magic

ngrok's effectiveness stems from its sophisticated use of modern networking technologies. The service employs HTTP/2 for efficient multiplexing, WebSocket connections for real-time communication, and TLS encryption for security. This combination creates a robust, scalable platform that can handle everything from simple HTTP services to complex TCP applications like SSH.

The distributed nature of ngrok's infrastructure means your traffic is routed through the most efficient path possible, minimizing latency while maximizing reliability. Regional servers ensure that your connections remain fast regardless of your geographic location.


## Prerequisites

Before diving into the ngrok configuration for SSH access, it's crucial to ensure all prerequisites are met. This section details every component you'll need and the verifications you should perform to guarantee a smooth setup process.

### System Requirements

**Operating System**: This tutorial is specifically designed for macOS (formerly Mac OS X). The instructions have been thoroughly tested on the following versions:
- macOS Monterey (12.x)
- macOS Ventura (13.x)
- macOS Sonoma (14.x)
- macOS Sequoia (15.x)

**Architecture**: ngrok supports both Intel processors (x86_64) and Apple Silicon (ARM64/M1/M2/M3). The installation process automatically detects your architecture and downloads the appropriate version.

**Disk Space**: You'll need at least 50 MB of free space for ngrok installation and configuration files. While this might seem minimal, it's always wise to have additional space for logs and temporary files.

**Memory**: A minimum of 4 GB of RAM is recommended, though ngrok itself uses very few system resources. The memory requirement is more about ensuring your system runs smoothly while handling SSH connections.

### ngrok Account Setup

**Account Registration**: You'll need an active ngrok account to obtain your authtoken and configure fixed domains. Head over to [https://ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) to create your account. The registration process is straightforward and typically takes just a few minutes.

**Subscription Plan**: To use fixed domains (like `loving-lion-violently.ngrok.app`), you'll need a paid subscription. The free plan only offers temporary domains that change with each session, which isn't practical for consistent SSH access.

**Authtoken**: After creating your account, you'll receive a unique authtoken. In this tutorial, we'll use the example authtoken: `30NUz3VLxmzNjmtmBdMnY7WfrtL_LmQv5Gn3pE1YbiLAr1t9`

**Reserved Domain**: For this tutorial, we'll assume you have the domain `loving-lion-violently.ngrok.app` reserved in your account. If you don't have a reserved domain yet, you can create one through the ngrok dashboard.

### SSH Configuration on macOS

**SSH Server Enabled**: macOS needs to have the SSH server enabled and running. This isn't enabled by default for security reasons, so you'll need to activate it manually.

To verify and enable SSH:

1. Open **System Preferences** (or **System Settings** on newer versions)
2. Navigate to **Sharing**
3. Check the **Remote Login** option
4. Configure which users can access via SSH

Alternatively, you can enable SSH through Terminal:
```bash
sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin on
```

**SSH Status Verification**: To confirm SSH is working locally, try connecting to yourself:
```bash
ssh localhost
```

If you can connect successfully, SSH is properly configured.

**User Configuration**: Ensure your user account has appropriate permissions and either a password set or SSH keys configured. Without proper authentication, you won't be able to establish SSH connections.

### Command Line Tools

**Terminal Proficiency**: You'll be using macOS Terminal extensively throughout this tutorial. Familiarity with basic command-line operations is essential. If you're new to Terminal, spend some time learning basic commands like `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, and `nano`.

**Homebrew (Optional but Recommended)**: While not strictly required, Homebrew makes installing ngrok much easier. If you don't have Homebrew installed:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

**curl or wget**: For downloading files and testing connectivity. curl comes pre-installed on macOS, so you're already set.

**Text Editor**: You'll need a text editor for modifying configuration files. This can be nano, vim, or any editor you're comfortable with. Even TextEdit works if you prefer a graphical interface.

### Technical Knowledge Requirements

**SSH Fundamentals**: A basic understanding of how SSH works is crucial. This includes concepts like public/private key pairs, authentication methods, and basic SSH commands. You don't need to be an expert, but familiarity helps.

**Terminal/Command Line**: Comfort with navigating directories, executing commands, and editing files via terminal is essential. Most of the configuration happens through command-line interfaces.

**Networking Concepts**: Basic understanding of ports, TCP/IP protocols, and tunneling concepts will help you understand what's happening behind the scenes.

**YAML Syntax**: ngrok uses YAML configuration files, so basic familiarity with YAML syntax is helpful. Don't worry if you're new to YAML - it's quite intuitive once you see a few examples.

### Connectivity Verification

**Internet Connection**: Verify your machine has stable internet access:
```bash
ping google.com
```

**ngrok Server Access**: Test connectivity to ngrok servers:
```bash
curl -I https://api.ngrok.com
```

**DNS Resolution**: Ensure DNS resolution works correctly:
```bash
nslookup ngrok.com
```

### Security Considerations

**Local Firewall**: Check your macOS firewall settings. ngrok needs to make outbound connections to ngrok servers, which most firewall configurations allow by default.

**Antivirus Software**: Some antivirus programs might interfere with ngrok. If you're running third-party security software, you may need to add ngrok to your exceptions list.

**Corporate Policies**: If you're on a corporate network, verify that there are no policies blocking outbound connections to tunneling services. Some organizations restrict such services for security reasons.

### Environment Preparation

**Working Directory**: Create a dedicated directory for ngrok-related files:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/ngrok-config
cd ~/ngrok-config
```

**Configuration Backup**: If you already have custom SSH configurations, create backups:
```bash
cp ~/.ssh/config ~/.ssh/config.backup
```

**Access Documentation**: Keep a secure record of your credentials and configurations for future reference. Consider using a password manager to store sensitive information securely.

python3 -m http.server 8000

# In another terminal
ngrok http 8000
```

With ngrok properly installed and verified, you're ready to proceed with the initial configuration and authentication setup. The installation process might seem straightforward, but taking time to verify everything works correctly will save you troubleshooting time later in the process.


## Initial Configuration

After successfully installing ngrok, the next crucial step involves configuring authentication and basic settings. This section will guide you through the authentication process using your authtoken and verification of all configurations to ensure everything is working properly.

### Authentication with Authtoken

The authtoken serves as your unique authentication key that connects your local ngrok installation to your online account. Without this configuration, you won't be able to access advanced features like fixed domains, which are essential for consistent SSH access.

**Step 1: Configure the Authtoken**

Use the `ngrok config add-authtoken` command to set up your authentication:
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken 30NUz3VLxmzNjmtmBdMnY7WfrtL_LmQv5Gn3pE1YbiLAr1t9
```

This command saves your authtoken to ngrok's configuration file, which will be automatically used in all future sessions. The configuration is stored securely on your local machine and doesn't need to be entered again unless you change accounts or reset your configuration.

**Step 2: Verify Configuration**

Confirm the authtoken was configured correctly:
```bash
ngrok config check
```

You should see output similar to:
```
Valid configuration file at /Users/[your-username]/Library/Application Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml
```

This confirmation indicates that ngrok found your configuration file and validated its contents successfully.

**Step 3: Test Authentication**

Test the authentication by making a simple connection:
```bash
ngrok http 80
```

If authentication is working correctly, you'll see the ngrok web interface with tunnel information. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the test tunnel.

### Configuration File Location

ngrok stores its configuration in a YAML file located in different directories depending on the operating system. On macOS, the configuration file is located at:

```
~/Library/Application Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml
```

**View Configuration File:**
```bash
cat "~/Library/Application Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml"
```

The file should contain something similar to:
```yaml
version: "2"
authtoken: 30NUz3VLxmzNjmtmBdMnY7WfrtL_LmQv5Gn3pE1YbiLAr1t9
```

Understanding this file structure is important because you'll be modifying it later to add advanced configurations for your SSH tunnel.

### Additional Basic Configuration

Beyond the authtoken, you can configure other basic options that will enhance your ngrok experience and optimize it for your specific use case.

**Region Configuration**

By default, ngrok automatically connects to the nearest region. However, you can specify a particular region if needed:
```bash
ngrok config add-region us
```

Available regions include:
- `us` - United States
- `eu` - Europe
- `ap` - Asia-Pacific
- `au` - Australia
- `sa` - South America
- `jp` - Japan
- `in` - India

Choosing the right region can significantly impact latency and connection quality, especially for SSH sessions where responsiveness matters.

**Log Level Configuration**

For debugging purposes, you can configure the log level:
```bash
ngrok config add-log-level info
```

Available levels: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `crit`

The `debug` level provides the most detailed information, which can be helpful when troubleshooting connection issues, while `error` only shows critical problems.

**Console UI Configuration**

You can disable the local web interface if you prefer:
```bash
ngrok config add-console-ui false
```

However, for SSH tunnels, the web interface provides valuable monitoring information, so it's generally recommended to keep it enabled.

### Online Account Verification

It's crucial to verify that your online account is properly configured and that your reserved domain is available and active.

**Step 1: Access Dashboard**

Navigate to [https://dashboard.ngrok.com](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and log in with your credentials. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your account status, active tunnels, and configuration options.

**Step 2: Verify Authtoken**

In the dashboard, go to the "Your Authtoken" section and confirm that the displayed token matches what you configured:
`30NUz3VLxmzNjmtmBdMnY7WfrtL_LmQv5Gn3pE1YbiLAr1t9`

**Step 3: Verify Reserved Domain**

In the "Reserved Domains" or "Domains" section, confirm that `loving-lion-violently.ngrok.app` is listed and shows as active. The domain should display a green status indicator or similar confirmation of availability.

**Step 4: Verify Subscription Plan**

Confirm your account has an active paid plan, which is required for using reserved domains. Free accounts are limited to temporary domains that change with each session.

### Configuration Backup

Creating backups of your configuration is a wise practice that can save you significant time if you need to recover from issues or migrate to a new machine.

**Backup Configuration File:**
```bash
cp "~/Library/Application Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml" "~/ngrok-config/ngrok-backup.yml"
```

**Backup SSH Configurations:**
```bash
cp ~/.ssh/config ~/.ssh/config.ngrok-backup
```

**Create Backup Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# backup-ngrok-config.sh
BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/ngrok-config/backups/$(date +%Y%m%d)"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
cp "~/Library/Application Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml" "$BACKUP_DIR/"
cp ~/.ssh/config "$BACKUP_DIR/" 2>/dev/null
echo "Backup created in $BACKUP_DIR"
```

### Advanced Connectivity Testing

Perform more detailed tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly before proceeding with SSH-specific configuration.

**API Connectivity Test:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 30NUz3VLxmzNjmtmBdMnY7WfrtL_LmQv5Gn3pE1YbiLAr1t9" \
     -H "Ngrok-Version: 2" \
     https://api.ngrok.com/tunnels
```

This test verifies that your authtoken works with ngrok's API and that you can access account-specific features.

**DNS Resolution Test:**
```bash
nslookup loving-lion-violently.ngrok.app
```

This confirms that your reserved domain is properly configured in DNS and can be resolved from your location.

**TCP Connectivity Test:**
```bash
nc -zv loving-lion-violently.ngrok.app 22
```

Note that this test might fail initially since you haven't started your SSH tunnel yet, but it's useful for verifying that the domain resolves and that there are no network-level blocks.

### Environment Variables (Optional)

For convenience, you can set up environment variables to make working with ngrok easier:

**Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile:**
```bash
echo 'export NGROK_AUTHTOKEN="30NUz3VLxmzNjmtmBdMnY7WfrtL_LmQv5Gn3pE1YbiLAr1t9"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export NGROK_DOMAIN="loving-lion-violently.ngrok.app"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

**Reload shell:**
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

These environment variables can be useful in scripts and automation later in the process.

### Configuration Troubleshooting

**Issue: Invalid authtoken**

If you receive an invalid authtoken error:
1. Verify you copied the token correctly
2. Confirm your account is active
3. Try reconfiguring: `ngrok config add-authtoken [your-token]`

**Issue: Configuration file not found**

If ngrok can't find the configuration file:
```bash
mkdir -p "~/Library/Application Support/ngrok"
ngrok config add-authtoken 30NUz3VLxmzNjmtmBdMnY7WfrtL_LmQv5Gn3pE1YbiLAr1t9
```

**Issue: File permissions**

If there are permission issues:
```bash
chmod 600 "~/Library/Application Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml"
```

**Issue: Connectivity to ngrok servers**

If you can't connect to ngrok servers:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify no firewall is blocking connections
3. Try a different region

### Final Configuration Verification

Before proceeding to SSH-specific configuration, run through this checklist to ensure everything is properly set up:

- [ ] Authtoken configured correctly
- [ ] Configuration file created and accessible
- [ ] Connectivity to ngrok servers working
- [ ] Reserved domain visible in dashboard
- [ ] Account with active paid plan
- [ ] Configuration backups created

**Complete Verification Command:**
```bash
ngrok config check && \
echo "Authtoken: $(grep authtoken ~/Library/Application\ Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml)" && \
echo "Reserved domain: loving-lion-violently.ngrok.app" && \
nslookup loving-lion-violently.ngrok.app
```

This command performs a comprehensive check of your configuration and provides immediate feedback on any issues.

With the initial configuration complete and verified, you're ready to configure your fixed domain and establish the SSH tunnel. The foundation you've built here will support all the advanced features and automation you'll implement in the following sections.


## Fixed Domain Configuration

One of the most significant advantages of using a paid ngrok account is the ability to reserve fixed domains that remain constant across sessions. Your reserved domain `loving-lion-violently.ngrok.app` will provide a consistent address for SSH access, eliminating the need to update configurations every time you start a new session.

### Understanding Reserved Domains

Reserved domains in ngrok are unique subdomains of ngrok's infrastructure that become permanently associated with your account [2]. Unlike temporary domains that are generated automatically, reserved domains maintain the same address regardless of when you start or restart your tunnels.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Persistence**: The domain remains the same across sessions
- **Exclusivity**: Only your account can use this specific domain
- **Flexibility**: Can be used for different types of tunnels (HTTP, TCP, TLS)
- **Reliability**: Allows configuring SSH clients with fixed addresses

### Domain Verification

Before configuring the SSH tunnel, verify that your reserved domain is properly configured and accessible.

**Verify DNS Resolution:**
```bash
nslookup loving-lion-violently.ngrok.app
```

**Test Basic Connectivity:**
```bash
ping loving-lion-violently.ngrok.app
```

### TCP Tunnel Configuration for SSH

To use your reserved domain with SSH, configure a TCP tunnel that directs traffic to local port 22 (SSH's default port).

**Basic Test Command:**
```bash
ngrok tcp 22 --domain=loving-lion-violently.ngrok.app
```

This command creates a TCP tunnel that:
- Listens on domain `loving-lion-violently.ngrok.app`
- Redirects all traffic to `localhost:22`
- Maintains the tunnel until interrupted

**Expected Output:**
```
ngrok                                                          

Session Status                online
Account                       [your-email] (Plan: [your-plan])
Version                       3.x.x
Region                        United States (us)
Latency                       [latency]ms

## SSH Configuration

Proper SSH configuration is crucial for secure and efficient access through the ngrok tunnel. This section covers everything from basic setup to advanced security configurations.

### SSH Server Verification

**Check SSH Status:**
```bash
sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin
```

**Enable SSH if needed:**
```bash
sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin on
```

**Verify SSH Process:**
```bash
sudo launchctl list | grep ssh
sudo lsof -i :22
```

### SSH Key Configuration

For enhanced security, configure SSH key authentication instead of password-based authentication.

**Generate SSH Keys:**
```bash
# Ed25519 (recommended)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"

# RSA (alternative)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"
```

**Configure Authorized Keys:**
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

### SSH Client Configuration

Create an SSH config file for easy connection management:

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

**Configuration Content:**
```
# ngrok SSH configuration
Host ngrok-ssh
    HostName loving-lion-violently.ngrok.app
    Port 22
    User [your-username]
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
    TCPKeepAlive yes
    Compression yes

# Local SSH configuration
Host localhost-ssh
    HostName localhost
    Port 22
    User [your-username]
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

**Test Configuration:**
```bash
ssh ngrok-ssh
```

## Security and Best Practices

Security is paramount when exposing SSH access through ngrok. This section covers essential security measures and best practices.

### SSH Security Hardening

**Disable Password Authentication:**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add/modify:
```
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
UsePAM no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin no
MaxAuthTries 3
```

**Restart SSH Service:**
```bash
sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
```

### Firewall Configuration

**Enable macOS Firewall:**
```bash
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate on
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setstealthmode on
```

### Monitoring and Alerting

**Create Security Monitor:**
```bash
nano ~/bin/ssh-security-monitor.sh
```

**Monitor Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# SSH Security Monitor
ALERT_LOG="/tmp/ssh-security-alerts.log"

# Monitor failed login attempts
failed_attempts=$(tail -100 /var/log/auth.log | grep "Failed password" | wc -l)
if [ "$failed_attempts" -gt 5 ]; then
    echo "[$(date)] ALERT: Multiple failed login attempts: $failed_attempts" >> "$ALERT_LOG"
    osascript -e "display notification \"Multiple failed SSH attempts detected\" with title \"Security Alert\""
fi

# Monitor successful logins from unknown IPs
tail -50 /var/log/auth.log | grep "Accepted" | while read line; do
    ip=$(echo "$line" | grep -oE '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}')
    if [ ! -z "$ip" ] && ! grep -q "$ip" ~/.ssh/known_ips 2>/dev/null; then
        echo "[$(date)] ALERT: Login from unknown IP: $ip" >> "$ALERT_LOG"
        echo "$ip" >> ~/.ssh/known_ips
    fi
done
```


## Free User Configuration

Not everyone needs or can afford a paid ngrok subscription, and that's perfectly fine. The free tier of ngrok still provides excellent functionality for SSH access, though with some limitations. This section is specifically designed for users who want to set up SSH access using ngrok's free plan without reserved domains.

### Understanding Free Plan Limitations

Before diving into the configuration, it's important to understand what the free plan offers and its limitations:

**What's Included in Free Plan:**
- Up to 1 online ngrok agent
- 4 tunnels per agent
- 40 connections per minute
- HTTP/TCP tunnels
- Basic authentication
- Web inspection interface

**Free Plan Limitations:**
- No reserved domains (domains change each session)
- Limited bandwidth
- No custom subdomains
- Basic support only
- Connection limits

**Why This Still Works for SSH:**
Despite these limitations, the free plan is perfectly adequate for personal SSH access, development work, and occasional remote connections. The changing domain names are manageable with proper configuration and scripts.

### Setting Up ngrok Free Account

**Step 1: Create Free Account**

Visit [https://ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) and sign up for a free account. The process is straightforward and doesn't require payment information.

**Step 2: Get Your Authtoken**

After creating your account, navigate to the dashboard and copy your authtoken. It will look something like:
`1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j_AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz123456789`

**Step 3: Configure Authtoken**

Configure your authtoken using the ngrok command:
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j_AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz123456789
```

### Basic SSH Tunnel Setup for Free Users

**Step 1: Start SSH Tunnel**

Since you don't have a reserved domain, start the tunnel with a simple command:
```bash
ngrok tcp 22
```

**Step 2: Note the Generated Domain**

ngrok will generate a random domain for your session. The output will look like:
```
ngrok                                                          

Session Status                online
Account                       [your-email] (Plan: Free)
Version                       3.x.x
Region                        United States (us)
Latency                       45ms
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:12345 -> localhost:22

Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                              0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```

In this example, your SSH access would be: `ssh username@0.tcp.ngrok.io -p 12345`

**Step 3: Test Connection**

Test your SSH connection using the generated domain and port:
```bash
ssh [your-username]@0.tcp.ngrok.io -p 12345
```

### Managing Dynamic Domains

The biggest challenge with free accounts is managing the changing domains. Here are several strategies to make this manageable:

**Strategy 1: Domain Notification Script**

Create a script that automatically notifies you of the current domain:

```bash
nano ~/bin/get-ngrok-domain.sh
```

**Script Content:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get current ngrok domain and port
NGROK_API="http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels"

# Check if ngrok is running
if ! curl -s $NGROK_API > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "ngrok is not running or API is not accessible"
    exit 1
fi

# Get tunnel information
TUNNEL_INFO=$(curl -s $NGROK_API | python3 -c "
import sys, json
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
for tunnel in data['tunnels']:
    if tunnel['proto'] == 'tcp':
        url = tunnel['public_url']
        print(f'SSH Domain: {url.replace(\"tcp://\", \"\")}')
        break
")

echo "$TUNNEL_INFO"

# Optional: Send notification
osascript -e "display notification \"$TUNNEL_INFO\" with title \"ngrok SSH Domain\""

# Optional: Copy to clipboard
echo "$TUNNEL_INFO" | pbcopy
echo "Domain copied to clipboard"
```

**Make Executable:**
```bash
chmod +x ~/bin/get-ngrok-domain.sh
```

**Strategy 2: Dynamic SSH Config Update**

Create a script that automatically updates your SSH config with the current domain:

```bash
nano ~/bin/update-ssh-config.sh
```

**Script Content:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update SSH config with current ngrok domain
SSH_CONFIG="$HOME/.ssh/config"
NGROK_API="http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels"

# Get current tunnel info
TUNNEL_DATA=$(curl -s $NGROK_API)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Failed to get ngrok tunnel information"
    exit 1
fi

# Extract domain and port
DOMAIN_PORT=$(echo "$TUNNEL_DATA" | python3 -c "
import sys, json
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
for tunnel in data['tunnels']:
    if tunnel['proto'] == 'tcp':
        url = tunnel['public_url']
        # Remove tcp:// and split domain:port
        clean_url = url.replace('tcp://', '')
        domain, port = clean_url.split(':')
        print(f'{domain} {port}')
        break
")

if [ -z "$DOMAIN_PORT" ]; then
    echo "No TCP tunnel found"
    exit 1
fi

DOMAIN=$(echo $DOMAIN_PORT | cut -d' ' -f1)
PORT=$(echo $DOMAIN_PORT | cut -d' ' -f2)

# Backup current SSH config
cp "$SSH_CONFIG" "$SSH_CONFIG.backup"

# Remove old ngrok-free entry if exists
sed -i '' '/# ngrok-free-start/,/# ngrok-free-end/d' "$SSH_CONFIG"

# Add new ngrok-free configuration
cat >> "$SSH_CONFIG" << EOF

# ngrok-free-start
Host ngrok-free
    HostName $DOMAIN
    Port $PORT
    User [your-username]
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
    TCPKeepAlive yes
    Compression yes
# ngrok-free-end
EOF

echo "SSH config updated:"
echo "Domain: $DOMAIN"
echo "Port: $PORT"
echo "Connect with: ssh ngrok-free"
```

**Strategy 3: Startup Script with Domain Logging**

Create a comprehensive startup script that handles everything:

```bash
nano ~/bin/start-ngrok-free.sh
```

**Script Content:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Comprehensive ngrok free startup script
LOG_FILE="$HOME/ngrok-domains.log"
PID_FILE="/tmp/ngrok-free.pid"

# Function to log with timestamp
log() {
    echo "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] $1" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
}

# Check if ngrok is already running
if [ -f "$PID_FILE" ]; then
    PID=$(cat "$PID_FILE")
    if ps -p $PID > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        log "ngrok is already running (PID: $PID)"
        ~/bin/get-ngrok-domain.sh
        exit 0
    else
        rm "$PID_FILE"
    fi
fi

# Start ngrok in background
log "Starting ngrok SSH tunnel..."
nohup ngrok tcp 22 > /tmp/ngrok-free.out 2>&1 &
NGROK_PID=$!
echo $NGROK_PID > "$PID_FILE"

# Wait for ngrok to start
sleep 10

# Get and log domain information
if ps -p $NGROK_PID > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    DOMAIN_INFO=$(~/bin/get-ngrok-domain.sh 2>/dev/null)
    if [ ! -z "$DOMAIN_INFO" ]; then
        log "ngrok started successfully: $DOMAIN_INFO"
        ~/bin/update-ssh-config.sh
        
        # Send notification
        osascript -e "display notification \"$DOMAIN_INFO\" with title \"ngrok SSH Ready\""
    else
        log "ngrok started but domain not yet available"
    fi
else
    log "Failed to start ngrok"
    rm "$PID_FILE"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Configuration File for Free Users

Create a simplified configuration file for free users:

```bash
nano "~/Library/Application Support/ngrok/ngrok.yml"
```

**Free User Configuration:**
```yaml
# ngrok Free User Configuration
version: "2"

# Authentication (replace with your free authtoken)
authtoken: 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j_AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz123456789

# Global settings
region: us
console_ui: true
log_level: info
log_format: term
log: /tmp/ngrok-free.log

# Tunnel definitions for free users
tunnels:
  # SSH tunnel (no domain since it's free)
  ssh-free:
    proto: tcp
    addr: 22
    metadata: "Free SSH access"
    
  # Optional: HTTP tunnel for web services
  web-free:
    proto: http
    addr: 8080
    metadata: "Free web access"

# API configuration
api:
  addr: localhost:4041
  
# Web interface
web_addr: localhost:4040
```

### Automation for Free Users

**LaunchAgent for Free Users:**

```bash
nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ngrok.ssh.free.plist
```

**LaunchAgent Content:**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.ngrok.ssh.free</string>
    
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/Users/[your-username]/bin/start-ngrok-free.sh</string>
    </array>
    
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <dict>
        <key>SuccessfulExit</key>
        <false/>
    </dict>
    
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/ngrok-free-agent.out</string>
    
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/ngrok-free-agent.err</string>
    
    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>/Users/[your-username]</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

**Load LaunchAgent:**
```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ngrok.ssh.free.plist
```

### Best Practices for Free Users

**Domain Tracking:**
Always keep a log of your domains and when they were active. This helps with troubleshooting and provides a history of your connections.

**Connection Limits:**
Be mindful of the 40 connections per minute limit. For normal SSH usage, this shouldn't be an issue, but automated scripts might hit this limit.

**Backup Plans:**
Since free domains change, always have alternative connection methods available (VPN, direct IP when possible, etc.).

**Security Considerations:**
Free accounts have the same security features as paid accounts for the tunnel itself. However, the changing domains mean you can't implement domain-specific security measures.

### Upgrading from Free to Paid

When you're ready to upgrade to a paid plan for reserved domains:

**Step 1: Upgrade Account**
Visit your ngrok dashboard and upgrade to a paid plan.

**Step 2: Reserve Domain**
Once upgraded, reserve a domain in the dashboard.

**Step 3: Update Configuration**
Modify your configuration files to use the reserved domain instead of dynamic domains.

**Step 4: Update Scripts**
Modify your automation scripts to use the fixed domain instead of dynamic domain detection.

The free plan provides an excellent way to get started with ngrok SSH access and evaluate whether the service meets your needs before committing to a paid subscription.


## External Server Connections

Once your ngrok SSH tunnel is active, external servers and clients from around the world can connect to your local macOS machine. This section provides comprehensive guidance for different operating systems and scenarios, ensuring that anyone can successfully establish SSH connections to your MacBook through the ngrok tunnel.

### Understanding the Connection Process

When your ngrok tunnel is active, your local SSH server becomes accessible through the ngrok domain. External clients connect to the ngrok servers, which then forward the connection through the secure tunnel to your local machine. This process is transparent to the connecting client - they simply see a standard SSH server at the ngrok domain.

The connection flow works as follows:
1. External client initiates SSH connection to your ngrok domain
2. ngrok cloud infrastructure receives the connection
3. Connection is forwarded through the secure tunnel to your local machine
4. Your local SSH server handles the authentication and session
5. All subsequent traffic flows through this established tunnel

### Connection from Linux Systems

Linux systems have excellent SSH support built-in, making connections to your ngrok tunnel straightforward.

**Basic Connection Command:**
```bash
ssh username@loving-lion-violently.ngrok.app
```

**Connection with Specific Key:**
```bash
ssh -i /path/to/private/key username@loving-lion-violently.ngrok.app
```

**Connection with Custom Port (for free users):**
```bash
ssh username@0.tcp.ngrok.io -p 12345
```

**Advanced Linux Connection Options:**

For Linux users who need more control over their SSH connections, here are advanced configuration options:

**Create SSH Config Entry:**
```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

**Add Configuration:**
```

The basic connection flow shows the fundamental path that SSH traffic takes when connecting through ngrok:

1. **Local Machine (macOS)**: Your MacBook runs the SSH server on port 22 and the ngrok agent
2. **ngrok Agent**: Establishes and maintains the secure tunnel to ngrok cloud servers
3. **ngrok Cloud**: Receives external connections and forwards them through the tunnel
4. **External Clients**: Any device (laptop, desktop, mobile) connecting via SSH

The flow is bidirectional, with responses following the same path in reverse. All traffic is encrypted both by SSH and by the ngrok tunnel, providing double-layer security.

This sequence diagram illustrates the step-by-step process of SSH authentication through ngrok:

1. **External Client** initiates SSH connection to `loving-lion-violently.ngrok.app`
2. **ngrok Cloud** receives the request and validates the domain
3. **Request forwarded** through the secure tunnel to the local MacBook
4. **SSH Daemon** on MacBook processes the authentication request
5. **Key exchange** occurs between client and SSH daemon
6. **Authentication response** flows back through the same path
7. **Secure SSH session** is established end-to-end

This process typically takes just a few seconds but involves multiple security validations at each step.

### Data Flow Analysis

Understanding how data flows through the system helps with performance optimization and troubleshooting:

**Outbound Connection Establishment:**
- ngrok agent establishes persistent WebSocket connection to ngrok servers
- Connection uses TLS encryption and includes authentication tokens
- Heartbeat messages maintain connection health

**Inbound Connection Handling:**
- External SSH requests arrive at ngrok edge servers
- Requests are validated against reserved domain configuration
- Traffic is multiplexed through existing tunnel to local machine

**Bidirectional Data Transfer:**
- All SSH traffic flows through the established tunnel
- ngrok handles protocol translation and connection management
- Local SSH daemon processes commands and returns responses
